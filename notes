Designing Program
* Programs must be designed before they are written

Program Develepment Cycle:
- Design Program
- Write Code
- Correct Syntax Errors
- Test the Program
- Correct login Errors

* Design is the most important part of a Develepment Cycle

Understand the task that the Program is to Perform
- Work with customer to get a sense what program is supposed to do
- Ask questions about the program Details
- Create one or more software developments

* Determine the steps that must be taken to perform the task
- Break down required task into series of steps
- Create an algorithm, listing logical steps that must be taken

PseudoCode: Fake Code
- informal language that has no syntax Errors
- not meant to be compiled or executed
- used to create model program
  - no need to worry about syntax errors, can focus on program's Design
  - Can be tranlated directly into actual code in any programming language

Flowcharts
* Flowchart: diagram that graphically depicts the steps in a a program 
- Ovals are termminal symbols
- Parallelorams are input and output symbols
- Rectangles are processing symbols
- Symbols are connected by arrows that represent the flow of the program.

Displaying Output with the print fuction
* print function: displays output on the screem
 
 eg: 
 >>> print('Hello World') 
 Hello World
 >>>

 Chapter 3 Decision Structure and Boolean Logic

 Control Structure
  - To control flow of the program
  - 1 condition = 'if'
  - 2 condition = 'if or else'
  - 3 condition = 'elif'

Decision Structure
 - if
 - if else
 - elif
 - nested if else
